## SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences

- **SQL** databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema
- **SQL** databases are vertically scalable

- **SQL** databases are table-based
- **SQL** databases are better for multi-row transactions

### NOSQL

- **NoSQL** databases are non-relational.
- **NoSQL** databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
- **NoSQL** databases are horizontally scalable.

- **NoSQL** databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
