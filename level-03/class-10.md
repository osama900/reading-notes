1. What is a ‘call’?

   At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

   To invoke a routine in a programming language. Calling a routine consists of specifying the routine name and, optionally, parameters.

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

   It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

3. What does LIFO mean?

   Last In, First Out data structure

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself ) without an exit point.
