# operators and loops #

## operatos 
you can find many of operators in JS for example
<br>

1. **assignment operators:** this is the way that you assigns a valuw to its left operand based on the of its right operand (=) 
  for example x = 7 // thats mean variable (x) contain a value (7)

2. **Comparison operators:** compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true for example (var1 = var2) and there are many types for example

      - `Equal (==)` which return true if operand are Equal
      - `Not equal (!=)` which return true if operand are not Equal
      - `Strict equal (===)` Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
      - `Strict not equal (!==)` Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.
      - `Greater than (>)` Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	
      - `Greater than or equal (>=)` Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.	
      - `Less than (<)` Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	
      - `Less than or equal (<=)` Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.	

3. **Logical operators**Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value and they are :
      - Logical AND (&&) `expr1 && expr2` Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2
      - Logical OR (||) `expr1 || expr2` Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2
      - Logical NOT (!) `!expr` Returns false if its single operand that can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.

        


## Loops and iteration ##
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly and JS provide many of loops statments for example:

1. **for statments**

   - for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`.
   - a for statment looks like this 
     ```
     for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]){
     statement
      }
     ```

2. **while statment**
    - A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`

    -  while statement looks like this :
    ```
    while (condition){
    statement
    }
  ```
