# TEXT IN HTML #
we can work within text inside the html page in different way for example :
1. by using **heading and paragraphs** such as:
    -  ```html
            <h1> this is main heading</h1>
        ```
     and there are 6 level of them


    -  ```html
         <p>this paragraph start from here and
            that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a  new
        line.</p>
        ```
    
2. using **bold and italic** to apply bold or italic style to the text for example:
    -   ```html
            <p>example for a <b> bold</b> text, and this text <i> in italic</i>  </p>
        ```

3. uses of **horizontal lines and breaks** to insert a horizontal line and insert a empty line
    -   ```html
            <hr />
            <br />
        ```

4. using of **strong and em** to make the text or part of it strong and by default the web browser will show it as bold or to emphasis it and by default the web browser will show it as italic :
    -   ```html
            <p>this text will be in<strong>strong</strong></p>

            <p>but this text will be  <em>emphasis</em>.</p>
        ```
