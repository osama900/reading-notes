<br>

There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

<br>
also we have to consider about the which size is right and which format for what kind of images is right and is it possible to optimize our images to use in the web site 
<br>
we can use the images as it is or with css we can use it as a background 

it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses
<br>
<br>
### Adding Images ###
To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes `src` This tells the browser where it can find the image file and `alt` to provide additional information about the image like in this example
```html
 <img src="images/quokka.jpg" 
   alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian  marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />
```
also the size of an image can be changed using `height` and `width` attribute like this example

```html
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of  quokka" width="600" height="450" />
 ```
 ## Three Rules for Creating Images ##
 There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website which are :
1. **Save images in the right format** : use images in jpeg, gif, or png format
2. **Save images at the right size** :You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website 
3. **Use the correct resolution** : need to check what is the correct resolution for the devices
