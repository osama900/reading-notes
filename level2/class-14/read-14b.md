n late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. **They hadn’t yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy**, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.

along the way, they discovered "five key dynamics that set successful teams apart" from the rest which they are Psychological safety, Dependability, Structure and clarity, Meaning and Impact
and we will srtart talking about each one of these

1. **Psychological safety** : As Google put it, psychological safety is based on a primary question: "Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?

2. **Dependability** : When it comes down to it, no one likes working with someone who can't be depended on, and having an unreliable team member is guaranteed to cause problems, regardless if the person is not otherwise toxic.

To be a dependable team, all of its members need to complete their tasks on time and to the expected quality standards. Without that, the entire group will struggle, regardless of whether some are willing to pick up the slack.

3. **Structure and clarity** : Google also identified another good business basic as being particularly relevant: structure and clarity.

Employees need to clearly understand their role within the team, any current plans, and business goals that affect their work. Without this, workers may have a difficult time identifying who is responsible for what, why certain actions need to be done, and what the broader objectives happen to be. Cumulatively, this leads to uncertainty that can harm the team's ability to focus on what matters and cover all of its duties.

4. **Meaning** : In a world where cultural fit has become increasingly important, it's no surprise that those who feel personally connected to the business and their work are more likely to excel. People who are passionate about the company's mission experience higher levels of job satisfaction, which ultimately improves performance.

5. **Impact** : Beyond finding the work meaningful, the most talented teams also believe that what they do matters in a real way; that their contributions provide value and support positive change. This makes the day-to-day feel more important, as employees understand how their assigned tasks impact more significant goals in a fundamental way, making even tedious work seem valuable
   By creating teams that possess the five traits above, you are setting them up for success. So, instead of focusing solely on hard skills and education (even if the candidate has a degree from an Ivy league school), examine the personalities of your employees and make sure that they come together in these key areas. That way, they'll be primed to exceed expectations, innovate, and work like a well-oiled collaboration machine.
