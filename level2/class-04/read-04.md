pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

the “mechanics” of coding contain **the Driver** who manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. and **The Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer

a lot of reasons to use pair programming
- **more efficiency** : when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making even if it took a little longer time **but** the quality od the coding will be better
- **Engaged collaboration** : the experience will be more engaging it is harder to get lost or waisting time when someone relay on you also there is someone to ask for help 
- **Learning from fellow students** :working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of  thats why pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution 
- **Social skills** : pair programming can help programmers develop their interpersonal skills When working with someone who has a different coding style for example thats why the key is the communication and that will has a long time impact 
- **Job interview readiness** : pairing programming help in finding and hiring in jobs also  challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base with another person 
- **Work environment readiness** : pair programming teach us how to operate to actually deliver a product which help us to hit the ground running at a new job.
