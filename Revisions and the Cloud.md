**Git**  is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Thats mean since you have the ability to store every change in [github](https://github.com) for each team member and keep a track for each change [git](https://git-scm.com) will provide a controlling system for every piece of your projet 

<br>

# what is version control ? #
**Version control Systems**  are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

<br>

# the benifets of version control system #
1. A complete long-term change history of every file
2. Branching and merging 
3. Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software

# Seeing Your Remotes #
By running the **`git remote`** command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
<br>
By using git **`remote -v`** you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names
<br>
<br>

```
$ cd example

$ git remote -v

remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)

remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)
