# What is Markdown

markdown is a language that we will mainly use to document our work in github.com by using sytex 
markdown known as a non-alphabitc characters like # and *

these characters and others can be used to make :
* style text like for example making text bold italic 
* adding images 
* adding links
* ordered or unordered list

and a lot of other things :wink:

of course we can use an additional features by using flavored markdown
