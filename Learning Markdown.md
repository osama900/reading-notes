# What is Markdown

markdown is a language that we will **mainly** use to document our work in github.com by using syntex 
*markdown* known as a non-alphabitc characters like # and * for saving the markdown files need to be in .md or .markdown extenction

these characters and others can be used to make :
* style text like for example making text **bold** *italic*  ~~strikethrough~~
* adding images
