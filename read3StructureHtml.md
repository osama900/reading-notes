when you have an idea about a new project in ny thing you have to test it in a smal scale befoure you go do big to be more tention for every thing in the project.

in websites building its better to start in a small for example dont start designing the website directly, you can start from somthing smaller witch it is **Wireframing** 


**WIREFRAMING IS** using a diffirent shapes to **represnt the key element** that you see in the page in a simplest way which it can be started on paper to a more digital wireframing by using a special tools designed for that reason 

many diffreient tools are available to chose between some paid and some free to use like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) , [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/) 

all that tools will help me to reach a point that i'm more sure about what i should have in my project based on the user needs and to trace the user journey in my project

# WHAT IS **HTML** ? ##
short for **hyper text markup language** which it is a styling language by using a `<tags>` to style element in a web pages

also we can say that it is a punch of lines that tell the web browser **how to represent the web pages**

a few things we should consider:

1. the `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
2. the `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers
3.  the `<title>` element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in
4. the `<body>` element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.


in HTML  we can :

1. import image:
    - `<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">`

2. heading element :
    - `<h1>My main title</h1>`
    
3. writing paragraphs :
    - `<p>This is a single paragraph</p>`

and alot of other other diffrient things ...

# what is Semantics #
**Semantics** which it means what purpose or role does that HTML element have

also **JavaScript** have its ow Semantics in diffrent type and for diffirent use like `variales` , `lists` , `functions` and alot more.
