# operators and loops #

## operatos 
you can find many of operators in JS for example
<br>

1. **assignment operators:** this is the way that you assigns a valuw to its left operand based on the of its right operand (=) 
  for example x = 7 // thats mean variable (x) contain a value (7)

2. **Comparison operators:** compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true for example (var1 = var2) and there are many types for example

      - `Equal (==)` which return true if operand are Equal
      - `Not equal (!=)` which return true if operand are not Equal
      - `Strict equal (===)` Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
      - `Strict not equal (!==)` Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.
      - `Greater than (>)` Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	
      - `Greater than or equal (>=)` Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.	
      - `Less than (<)` Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	
      - `Less than or equal (<=)` Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
